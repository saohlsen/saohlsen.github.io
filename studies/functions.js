* Functions - are wrapped block of code that can be reused over and over, 
* and we do not have to rewrite the entire code every time we need to repeat. 
* JavaScript has many built in functions like console.log or methods that are
* also functions push() and pop().
* To create function, we need to start with keyword function, follow by the name
* (whatever we name it), and we can pass parameters inside the parentheses (), 
* functions accept zero or more parameters, lastly in curly braces we can input 
* code for action we want the function to perform.
* This is called function declaration. 
*

//Function declaration, zero parameters and calling function//

function greeting(){

}
console.log(greeting());  // prints => undefined



//Function declaration, one parameter and calling function //

function number(x){
 console.log(x);
}
number(5);           // prints => 5

/**
* Function expression on the other hand does not have the name and has 
* an anonymous function and is assigned to variable. 
* It can be IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression and runs when
* defined. Expresions are not hoisted like functiondeclaration. 
*/

// Function expression with two parameters

var add = function (n1, n2) {
	return n1 + n2;
};
add(2, 5);         // prints => 7
/**
* Parameters and Arguments - often confused, parameters are place
* holders for arguments. We pass parameters at the time of function
* declaration or expression, and arguments are values that
* parameters receive when a function is invoked. 
* In above example of add function expression, 2 and 5 are values
* that were passed to parameters.

/**
* Hoisting - is pulling up. In JavaScript it means that function
* can be used before is declared, but only function declaration,
* and not function expression.

* Scope - defines how and where variables can be accessed and used. 
* In JavaScript there are three scopes: global, local/function, and 
* block scope.

* Global Scope - refers to a window object of JavaScript.
* When variables is declared outside of function, it has global scope,
* They are global variables. 
*/

* Local Scope - also called function scope, variables that are declared
* inside a function. Variable var is bound to local scope when declared
* inside.

}

/**
* Block Scope - refers to variables declared in block scope, like 
* conditional statements or loops. Let and Const are variables that 
* are used in block scope.
